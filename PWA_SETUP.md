   - Install it and verify the icon appears correctly

2. **Test Standalone Mode:**
   - Launch the app from your home screen
   - Verify it opens without browser UI (no address bar)
   - Check that the status bar color matches the theme

3. **Test Offline Support:**
   - Load the app while online
   - Turn on airplane mode
   - Try to navigate around (cached pages should work)
   - Turn off airplane mode and verify live updates resume

4. **Test Icons:**
   - Check that the app icon looks good on your home screen
   - On Android, verify it adapts to your phone's icon shape

## üé® Customizing Your Icons (Optional)

If you want to customize the app icon design:

1. Edit `generate_icons.py` to change colors or design
2. Run: `python3 generate_icons.py`
3. Commit and push: 
   ```bash
   git add media/icons/
   git commit -m "Update app icons"
   git push origin main
   ```

Or use an online PWA icon generator:

## üöÄ Next Steps: Phase 2 & 3

### Phase 2: Upgrade Render to Starter Plan
**Purpose:** Eliminate cold starts (15 min spin-down on free tier)

**Steps:**
1. Log into Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your "parlay-tracker" service
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Instance Type**
4. Change from "Free" ‚Üí "Starter" ($7/month)
5. Confirm the upgrade

**Benefits:**
- Always-on (no cold starts)
- Faster response times
- More resources (512 MB RAM)
- Better for daily use

### Phase 3: Add Basic Authentication
**Purpose:** Password-protect admin functions (move bets, update stats)

**Implementation:**
- Add login page with password
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Protect `/admin/*` endpoints
- Session-based authentication

**Security Benefits:**
- Only you can modify data
- Public can still view bets
- Prevents unauthorized changes

## üìù Technical Details

### Caching Strategy:
- **API Requests** (`/api/*`, `/admin/*`): Network-first, cache fallback
- **Static Assets** (HTML, CSS, images): Cache-first, network fallback
- **Cache Updates**: Checks hourly for new versions

### Service Worker Lifecycle:
- Installed on first visit
- Caches critical assets immediately
- Updates in background when new version detected
- Old caches cleaned up automatically

### Browser Support:
- ‚úÖ iOS Safari 11.3+
- ‚úÖ Android Chrome 67+
- ‚úÖ Desktop Chrome, Edge, Firefox
- ‚ùå IE (not supported, but degrades gracefully)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" doesn't appear:
- **iOS**: Must use Safari (not Chrome/Firefox)
- **Android**: Must use Chrome
- Make sure you're on HTTPS (Render provides this)
- Try force-refreshing the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### App doesn't update after changes:
- Service worker is caching old version
- Force update: Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers ‚Üí Unregister
- Or wait 1 hour for automatic update check

### Icons don't show up:
- Check browser console for 404 errors on icon files
- Verify files exist in `media/icons/` directory
- Clear browser cache and reinstall app

### Offline mode not working:
- Service worker might not be registered
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `service-worker.js` is accessible at root URL

## üéØ What's Different Now?

**Before (Regular Web App):**
- Open browser ‚Üí Type URL ‚Üí Wait for load
- Browser UI always visible
- No offline support
- Slow on Render cold starts

**After (PWA):**
- Tap icon ‚Üí Instant launch (feels like native app)
- Full-screen experience
- Cached assets load instantly
- Works partially offline

---

## üìä Performance Improvements

With the service worker caching:
- **First visit**: Normal load time
- **Subsequent visits**: ~80% faster (cached assets)
- **Cold start impact**: Reduced (static assets load from cache)
- **Offline**: Basic functionality available

---

## ‚ú® Pro Tips

1. **Update Frequency**: Service worker checks for updates every hour
2. **Force Update**: Users can force update by closing and reopening app
3. **Cache Busting**: Service worker version changes trigger automatic updates
4. **Analytics**: Can add tracking to service worker for offline usage stats
5. **Push Notifications**: Can be added later for live bet updates

- Launch instantly from your home screen
- Feel like a native app
